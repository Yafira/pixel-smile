# Pixel Smile

This TypeScript supposed to create pixel art outputting a smiling face to the console, but were many errors and it didn't work. Until now...

The purpose of this project is to leverage TypeScriptâ€™s type system to fix bugs and guide in implementing the missing functions. After debugging, the expected output is a smiling face outputting to the console in a fun way.
