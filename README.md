# Pixel Smile

This TypeScript program supposed to create pixel art outputting a smiling face to the console, but there were many errors and it didn't work. Until now...

The purpose of this program is to leverage TypeScriptâ€™s type system to fix bugs and guide in implementing the missing functions. After debugging, the expected output is a smiling face outputting to the console while at the same having the opportunity to create art in a fun way.
